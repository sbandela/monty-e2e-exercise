Cloned the project monty-e2e-exercise to my local github account

Tried to download selenium standalone server and geckodriver from terminal
$ curl -O http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/3.0/selenium-server-standalone-3.0.1.jar
AND
$ curl -L https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.11.1/geckodriver-v0.11.1-macos.tar.gz | tar xz

I could not download the selenium standalone server and geckodriver since I was getting command not found on terminal.
Tried adding  /usr/local/bin in the $PATH by taking the following steps from the home directory
       nano .bash_profile
       export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
       echo $PATH returned /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
       Still getting "command not found".So I'm stuck and couldn't proceed further
So I manually downloaded the selenium standalone server 3.0 jar file from http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
and manually installed geckodriver-v0.11.1-macos.tar.gz from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/tag/v0.11.1

Also I alternatively downloaded selenium standalone via - 

    npm install selenium-standalone@latest -g
    selenium-standalone install
    selenium-standalone start
    
  However was getting the below error     
 Error: Selenium server did not start.
 Another Selenium process may already be running or your java version may be out of date.
       
 I already have node and npm installed
 node - v6.10.1
 npm - 3.10.10
